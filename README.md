# BabaYaga

PoC to create schemaless persistence layer in Kotlin on top of Postgresql heavily inspired by:

1. Uber schemaless: https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-one/
2. FriendFeed: https://backchannel.org/blog/friendfeed-schemaless-mysql

Please note that this project is created purely to experiment with schemaless on top of RDBMS idea. It does not aim to become product at some point.

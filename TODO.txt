TODO:

- insert into index (n-columns)
- insert into index in batches
- delete from index
- drop index tables
- findFirst
- findAll

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- entities table for mysql versions contains added_id int PK column to store entries in sequentail order. On Postgresql
it is not true (see http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/38710/how-does-postgresql-physically-order-new-records-on-disk-after-a-cluster-on-pri)
consider removing or leaving as it is but use only for indexes (see below)
- currently indexes are using soft FK on id, but theoretically could use native PK (NUMBER), curious what's more efficient when joining
